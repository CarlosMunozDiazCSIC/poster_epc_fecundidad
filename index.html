                    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
                    <p>The increment in the MAAD can influence the fertility outcomes in Spain and should be revised to consider it as a factor of the lowest low fertility pattern the country is performing.</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Most of the research has been done on the patterns and the relationship between age at first marriage (Esteve, Cortina and Cabré, 2009; Kolk, 2015) and the possible outcomes in fertility (Eurostat, 2018; Rotering and Bras, 2019), little is known about the age differences of parents at the time of their children’s birth (Dudel, Cheng, and Klüsener ,2020) as a possible factor of <i>low</i> and <i>lowest</i> low fertility.</p>

                        <p class="text">We suppose that the increase in the Mean Absolute Age Difference will give a disadvantage in the number of children that women can have if they have children with younger partners (Bongaarts & Feeney, 1998, Sobotka & Beaujouan 2017, Sobotka 2014).</p>

Mothers have a youngest distribution and the age span of having children is narrower than for the fathers. There are also more concentration of having the first kid around 32 since 2007 and remains increasing.</p>

                        <p class="text">Patterns show how the difference between the two calculations is also reducing with the time, which can be understood with the reduction in the number of women that are having children with more age-gap. We can also verify in this figure, that the counterfactual Crude Birth Rate (CBR_CF), remains higher and also the gap between the two tends to be bigger with the time.</p>

ACF and PACF, have a strong autoregressive and mean average components, and they can be modelled for the same ARMA (1,2) model. Cross-Correlation Function between MAAD and the Percentage of increment, show some lags in the middle term confirming the influence one process on the other. There is cross-correlation even though we differentiate the series looking for stationarity.</p>

                    <p>1. There is a statistical relation between the Mean Absolute Age Difference and the percentage of increase of hypothetical children, however, we cannot conclude causality as it will depend on some biological and social factors not considered.<br>2. To reduce the cohorts that are observed to make them coincide with the period that actually has developed fertility in each of the cohorts.<br>3. To include key periods (WWII, civil war, etc) as a background and to have them in the hypothesis.</p>
