                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Most of the research has been done on the patterns and the relationship between age at first marriage (Esteve, Cortina and Cabré, 2009; Kolk, 2015) and the possible outcomes in fertility (Eurostat, 2018; Rotering and Bras, 2019), little is known about the age differences of parents at the time of their children’s birth (Dudel, Cheng, and Klüsener ,2020) as a possible factor of the low and the lowest low fertility.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="main main__hypothesis">
                    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
                    <p>The increment in the MAAD can influence the fertility outcomes in Spain and should be revised to consider it as a factor of the lowest low fertility pattern the country is performing. This will give a disadvantage in the number of children that women can have if they have children with more age difference between their partners (Bongaarts & Feeney, 1998, Sobotka & Beaujouan 2017, Sobotka 2014).</p>

                    <p>• There is a statistical relation between the Mean Absolute Age Difference and the percentage of increase of hypothetical children, however, we cannot conclude causality as it will depend on some biological and social factors not considered in this study.<br>• To include key periods and stratification variables.</p>
